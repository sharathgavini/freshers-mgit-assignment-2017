Could not create jar file due to errors in maven


To run this, import the project in any IDE ( I used NetBeans).
Start running from App.java



Added documentation using javadocs.
Can view documentation from target/site/index.html



The code is a bit buggy. Can complete it in one more day but due to heavy pressure from academics, had to stop doing it now.
Thanks for this assignment. Hope you like my work :).
